## Guideline
When testing a series of positive terms $\sum a_k$ for convergence
1. Begin with _The Divergence Test_.
2. Is the series a special series? Recall the convergence of the following series.
  + Geometric Series
  + p-Series
  + Check also for a telescoping series
3. If the general kth term of the series looks like a function you can integrate, then try the _Integral Test_.
4. If the general kth term of the series involves $k!, k^k, a^k$, where $a$ is a constant, the Ratio Test is advisable. Series with k in an exponent yield to the Root Test.
5. If the general kth term of the series is a rational function of $k$ (or a root of a rational function), Use the _Direct Comparison Test_ or the _Limit Comparison Test_. (Use the families of series given in Step 2 as comparison series)
