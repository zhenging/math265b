True.

89\. **The limacon family** The equations $r = a + b \cos u$ and $r = a + b \sin u$ describe curves known as limaçons (from Latin for snail). We have already encountered cardioids, which occur when $|a| = |b|$. The limaçon has an inner loop if $|a| < |b|$. The limaçon has a dent or dimple if $|b| < |a| < 2|b|$. And, the limaçon is oval-shaped if $|a| > 2|b|$. Match the limaçons in the figures A–F with equations a–f.
a. $r=-1+\sin \th$ &emsp; b. $r=-1+2\cos \th$
c. $r=2+\sin \th$ &emsp; d. $r=1-2\cos \th$
e. $r=1+2\sin \th$ &emsp; f. $r=1+\frac{2}{3}\sin \th$
>Solution

d $\to$ D &emsp; e $\to$ E &emsp; f $\to$ F

95–98\. **The rose family** Equations of the form $r = a \sin m\th$ or $r = a \cos m\th$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $m$ is a positive integer, have graphs known as roses (see Example 6). Graph the following roses.

100–102\. **Spirals** Graph the following spirals. Indicate the direction in which the spiral winds outward as $\th$ increases, where $\th >0$. Let $a = 1$ and $a = -1$.
100\. Spiral of Archimedes: $r = a\th$
>Solution
![Graph (100)](../assets/1102_100.png)

110\. **Channel flow** Water flows in a shallow semicircular channel with inner and outer radii of $1 m$ and $2 m$ (see figure). At a point $P(r, \th)$ in the channel, the flow is in the tangential direction (counterclockwise along circles), and it depends only on $r$, the distance from the center of the semicircles.
d. Suppose the tangential velocity of the water is given by $v(r) = \frac{20}{r}, 1 \les r\les 2$. Is the velocity greater at $(1.8, \frac{\pi}{6})$ or $(1.3, \frac{2\pi}{3})$? Explain.
>Solution
The velocity would be greater at $(1.3, \frac{2\pi}{3})$, because $\frac{20}{1.3} > \frac{20}{1.8}$.

e. The total amount of water that flows through the channel
(across a cross section of the channel $\th = \th_0$) is proportional to $\dint_1^2 v(r)dr$. Is the total flow through the channel greater for the flow in part (c) or (d)?
>Solution
$v(r) = 10r \To \dint_1^2 v(r)dr = 5r^2 \mid_1^2 = 120$
$v(r) = \dfrac{20}{r} \To \dint_1^2 v(r)dr = 20(\ln r) \mid_1^2 = 13.86$
Thus, the flow in part (c) would be greater then that in part (d).
