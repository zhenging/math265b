To prove a statement $P(n)$ is true for every $n \mid n > n_{threshold}$ (positive integer)
1\. **Basic step** Show $P(n_{threshold})$ is true.
2\. **Hypothesis** Assume the statement for a value of $n=k, P(k)$ is true .
3\. **Induction step** Prove for $n=k+1, P(k+1)$ is true.

##### 6.2 The Pigeonhole Principle
**EX** 1-3, 5-7
**HW** 2, 6, 9

**Theorem 1 - The pigeonhole principle**
If **k** is a positive integer and **k+1** or more objects are placed into $k$ boxes, then there is at least one box containing two or more of the objects.
**Theorem 2 - Generalized pigeonhole principle**
If $N$ object are placed into $k$ boxes, then there is at least one box containing $\lceil N/k \rceil$ objects.

##### 6.3 Permutations and Combinations
**EX** 1-15, except 11
**HW** pg 434: 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 19, 22a,b,c, 27, 33, 34

* Permutation (order matters)
> If $n$ is positive integer and $r$ is an integer with $0 \leqslant r \leqslant n$, then there are $P(n, r) = n(n-1) \cdots (n-r+1) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$

* Combination (order does not matter)
> The number is $r$-combinations of a set with $n$ elements, where $n$ is a nonnegative integer and $r$ i an integer with $0 \leqslant r \leqslant n$, equals $C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}$

Let $A$ be positive integer. $R$ is "$a$ divides $b$"
a. Is $R$ reflective?
> Yes, since $\forall a a divides a$.

b. Is $R$ symmetric?
>No, because $2 \mid b$, but $b \nmid 2$
