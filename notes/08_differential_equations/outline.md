+ **Order**: The *order* of a differential equation is the order of the highest-order derivative that appears in the equation.
+ **Linear**: A differential equation is *linear* if the unknown function $y$ and its derivatives appear only to the first power and are not composed with other functions.
+ **General First-order Linear Differential Equation**: $\dfrac{dy}{dx} + p(x)y = q(x)$
+ **General solution**: The most general family of functions that solves a differential equation, including the appropriate number of arbitrary constants, is called (not surprisingly) the *general solution*.
